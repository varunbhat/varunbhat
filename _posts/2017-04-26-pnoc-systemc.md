# Photonic Network on chip documentation

The Project aims at simulating the Photonic network on chip architectures, namely,
* Corona
* Flexishare
* Firefly

The code is written using the SystemC Library and is based off of a Network on chip simulator, [NoCSim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nocsim/).
The Generated Documentation of the code can be found in this bitbucket link
[Manpage](https://varun-colostate.bitbucket.io/pnoc-systemc/)
